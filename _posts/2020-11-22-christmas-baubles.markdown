### First batch delivered, get yours in time for Christmas!
This year I've started making mini pet portrait Christmas baubles. It actually started with me wanting to create a portrait in memory of our cat who suddenly died earlier in the year as a result of a RTA. Then I made portraits of our current animals. After that  some of my friends asked if I could paint for them too. I still have some limited spaces before Christmas so if you'd like one like it, or a larger size animal portrait please do message me. They are hand painted images using acrylics, based on a good quality reference photo. They are varnished with satin and finished with a bow. £15 but 10% discount on multiple baubles if ordered within a single order. I deliver within Biddulph, postage is £2.50.
