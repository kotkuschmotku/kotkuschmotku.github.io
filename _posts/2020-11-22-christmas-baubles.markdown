### First batch delivered, get yours in time for Christmas!
This year I've started offering mini pet portrait Christmas baubles. It actually started with me wanting to create a portrait in memory of our beloved cat Dusty who suddenly died earlier in the year as a result of a RTA. After finishing portraits of him and our current pets some of my friends asked if I could paint for them too. 

I still have some limited spaces before Christmas so if you'd like one please do message me. They are hand painted images using acrylics, based on a good quality reference photo. They are varnished in  satin and finished with a bow. £15 but 10% discount on multiple baubles if ordered within a single order. Postage is £2.50.
